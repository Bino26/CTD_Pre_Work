# Star Wars API

It's a Pre-Work for Advanced Classes in CodeTheDream Classes

### Instructions

Your assignment is to create a basic webpage displaying items from the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/) if the API is down use: https://www.swapi.tech/. The requirements are:

    Create the HTML for the page
    Style the elements on the page using CSS
    Retrieve the data to display on the page using JavaScript to fetch the data from the Star Wars API (or the backup option) as needed
    Provide a README file that includes the instructions for running the webpage

The content that you decide to use from the api, as well as the way it is displayed, is up to you however at a minimum it should include the following:

    Display the data for at least 2 of the models in the API (we suggest starting with people and films)
    Provide a way for the user to navigate from each modelâ€™s page to the other models that are displayed
    The simplest version of this would allow going from a person to the films they are in and from a film to the characters in that film
    Issue new GET requests for the linked data to display in the linked pages

The project should be created as a repository in GitHub and a link to the repository should be submitted for assessment in the assessment form.
